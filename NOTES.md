**Executable BOT**  
Desc: As a game observer, I want to see a TicTacToe game played on the console between two BOTs, so that
I can understand how it works.  

UAT:  
Given an executable TicTacToe game,  
when the game is launched via shell script,  
then is printed on the shell console the game flow without any delay between the moves.

Scenario 1: Player X Won with vertical line!  
Player X:
X| |  
-+-+-  
X|O|  
-+-+-  
X| |O  
PLAYER X WON!  

- ‚úÖshould print an empty grid at the start of the game  
- ‚úÖshould have an empty grid at the start
